  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound">sound </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">music</a>, <strong>sampling</strong> is the reuse of a portion (or <strong>sample</strong>) of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction">sound recording</a> in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sound effects or longer portions of music, and may be layered, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio)">equalized</a>, sped up or slowed down, repitched, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)">looped</a>, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using electronic music instruments (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)">samplers</a>) or software such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">digital audio workstations</a>.

A process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with musique concr√®te, experimental music created by splicing and looping tape. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. The term sampling was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the Fairlight CMI, a synthesizer with the ability to record and playback short sounds. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.
