  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound">sound </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">music</a>, <strong>sampling</strong> is the reuse of a portion (or <strong>sample</strong>) of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction">sound recording</a> in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sound effects or longer portions of music, and may be layered, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio)">equalized</a>, sped up or slowed down, repitched, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)">looped</a>, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using electronic music instruments (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)">samplers</a>) or software such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">digital audio workstations</a>.

<p class="para">Prior to computer memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron was the most notable model, used by a number of groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical.</p>
